# Welcome! 👋

Rust3DS is a GitHub Organization with the objective of developing libraries and tools to integrate the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
in homebrew projects for the Nintendo 3DS system. 🦀 🎮

### _Ok, but why?_
The current technology used to develop homebrew games on the Nintendo 3DS family of consoles is extremely advanced, yet also very
unstable and hard to use for inexperienced users. From the pains of crashes and unending stack backtraces, Rust3DS was born, with the main goal of wrapping
the underlying system processes in a safe and performant way.

# Getting Started 🏃
You can check out the [wiki](https://github.com/rust3ds/ctru-rs/wiki) at [ctru-rs](https://github.com/rust3ds/ctru-rs) for more info on
installing and using our tools.

# Contribution 🔧

We are always open to contribution and feedback. If you have a feature you'd really love to see implemented, you can always open a PR or an issue
in the corresponding repository.

# Disclaimer
Rust3DS is NOT affiliated with Nintendo, nor do we use or work on their proprietary SDK.
